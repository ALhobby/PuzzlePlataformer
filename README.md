# Unnamed Puzzle Platformer Game

This is a small puzzle-platformer game, yet unamed. I am creating the game to get familar with Godot.

Design philosophy:
* The game should be accessible even to those that don't play games often.
* Goals should be clearly stated and represented.
* The visual style should be clean.
* No obscure secrets. Give clear hints.

Useful info:
* Pixel resolution is 640x360
* The tiles are 20x20 ???
